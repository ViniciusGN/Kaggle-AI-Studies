## Overview
My journey with Artificial Intelligence began as a trainee for the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) Student Chapter. There, I built a strong foundation in AI concepts and applications. 

Now, to continue my path of self-improvement while aligning with my specialization in Cybersecurity & Artificial Intelligence, I created this repository to serve as my portfolio for the AI-related courses at ENSICAEN. These courses include **Apprentissage**, **Fouille de Donn√©es**, and **AI Applications in Cybersecurity**.

Feel free to explore this repository and also check out my previous projects, such as [this one on wine analysis]([#](https://github.com/ViniciusGN/CIS-2-Trainee)). I hope you find these resources insightful and inspiring!
