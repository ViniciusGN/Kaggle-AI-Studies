# Machine Learning Class - ENSICAEN (Apprentissage)

## Overview
This project implements three practical activities (TP) for the **Apprentissage** (Machine Learning) course in the **2nd year of the Ingenierie Informatique program at ENSICAEN**, using Machine Learning techniques described in the Features section. Each TP explores a specific aspect of Machine Learning, with Python implementations using various scientific libraries.

## TP1: Linear and Polynomial Regression

### Objective
The goal of this TP is to familiarize students with statistical learning tools applied to linear and polynomial regression. We also explore regularization methods such as Ridge and Lasso.

### Content
- Introduction to Jupyter notebooks
- Implementation of linear regression using `sklearn`
- Polynomial transformation of data
- Regularization with Ridge and Lasso
- Visualization of results
- Gradient Descent

---

## TP2: Clustering

### Objective
This TP focuses on different clustering techniques, such as K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The emphasis is on data segmentation and cluster visualization.

### Content
- Implementation of K-Means and inertia analysis
- Application of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- Spectral clustering
- Comparison of different approaches

---

## TP3: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### Objective
The goal of this TP is to study SVMs, their functionality, and their application to data classification.

### Content
- Linear and non-linear separation with SVM
- Kernel selection (linear, RBF, polynomial)
- Hyperparameter optimization with `GridSearchCV`
- Model performance evaluation

---

## Running the Notebooks

### Prerequisites
- Python 3 installed
- Required libraries can be installed via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn scipy
  ```

### Running a TP
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <GITHUB_URL>
   cd Apprentissage
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open and execute the corresponding TP file.
