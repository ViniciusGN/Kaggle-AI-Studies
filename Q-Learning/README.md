# Rational Agent and Q-Learning Methods for Wumpus World üß†

## Overview
This project implements a Rational Agent and a Q-Learning-based Learning Agent for the Wumpus World environment. It serves as the final project for the Artificial Intelligence course in the **2nd year of the Ingenierie Informatique program at ENSICAEN**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status
üöß **The Q-Table implementation contains errors and is under revision.** The associated report might not reflect future corrections. üöß

## Authors

## Features
- **Rational Agent**: Implements a heuristic-based agent for navigating the Wumpus World.
- **Q-Learning Agent**: Utilizes reinforcement learning to adapt behavior in the environment.
- **Evaluation Mechanism**: Rewards and penalties based on the environment's states and transitions.
- **State Representation**: Maintains a grid-based state representation with attributes for safety, danger, and visited cells.

## Project Notes
- This repository **does not** include the entire `wumpus.py` file as it is part of ENSICAEN's proprietary course material.
- The code relies on external modules and dependencies from ENSICAEN‚Äôs framework, such as the Wumpus World environment. **These dependencies are not provided and are required for execution.**
- The project includes a report discussing the methodology and results. However, it may become outdated if the Q-Table issues are resolved.

---

## Limitations
- **Execution**: The project cannot be tested without ENSICAEN's additional Python files (e.g., environment and utility modules).
- **Proprietary Code**: Only the authored Rational Agent and Learning Agent are shared here, in compliance with ENSICAEN policies.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to access the Rational Agent and Learning Agent implementations.
2. Note that this project is for reference only, as it requires proprietary ENSICAEN resources to execute.

üìñ **Disclaimer**: This project is a work in progress, and the Q-Table errors are being actively investigated. Updates may follow.
